## How to use it ?
- Add your API key in the script on line number 6 of `NodeApp/index.js`
- open a terminal or powershell and type following command 
```bash
sh run.sh location=48.746816,9.101165 radius=150000 keyword=gmbh output=../finalBashTest
```

**Make sure you don't leave any unnecessary spaces in between (e.g. no space after a , or a .)**
